# Value-Based-Reinforcement-Learning-V-Value-Q-Value-Calculation
This notebook explores V-value and Q-value calculations in reinforcement learning by implementing dynamic programming techniques on an (n_row Ã— n_col) grid environment. The goal is to verify the relationship between V(s) and Q(s, a) using Bellman equations.
